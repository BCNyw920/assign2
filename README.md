# assign2
The infrastructure of this deployment was using and instance of EC2 to setup the overall network. After the overall network was established a VPC was created that would host an elastic load balancer which then would direct to 2 avaliability zones each with a public and private subnet. Each public subnet would have an elastic IP address, but i think i messed up because i only have 1 public subnet. The private subnets would hold web application servers as well as databases for mysql. Didnt know we actually had to deploy a webapp, just though we were suppose to setup the infrastructure so i ran out of time.
